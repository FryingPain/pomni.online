    <h1>pomni.online is disappearing.</h1>
	<p>The cost for the renew is way too high for a crap website like this. It simply isn't worth it.<br>No. I will not ask for donations as well.<br>I've ever since watched other series such as Hazbin Hotel and Murder Drones. Maybe i could make a MD website...<br>But anyway. Thank you for visiting my pomni website :3<br>POMNI LIVES FOREVER!!!</p>
